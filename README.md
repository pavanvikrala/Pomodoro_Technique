# Pomodoro_Technique
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method based on 25-minute stretches of focused work broken by five-minute breaks.
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, 
 traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 
This technique aims to improve focus and productivity by utilizing focused work periods and regular breaks. 
The timer is set for 25 minutes of work, followed by a 5-minute break. 
After completing four work intervals, a longer break of 20 minutes is taken. 
This cycle repeats to help maintain focus and avoid burnout.
